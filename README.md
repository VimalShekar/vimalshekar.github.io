## A little about myself!

Hi There!

This is Vimal, Welcome to my page. 


I am a software developer with about 8 years of IT experience. You can read about my roles on my LinkedIn Profile(link below).

## My Blog goals:
I have a passion for technology, and am thrilled whenever I get my hands dirty on new technologies and challenging problems. This blog here aims at tracking my learnings as a reference for my future self. It also aims at providing help to anyone else who has similar interests.

In the initial years, I always shied away from sharing anything online. But soon I realised the power of open source, with the github projects. Its impressive how sharing one's work, having others build upon it, and building upon other's work makes life easy for everyone. This realisation is why I decided to set up a blog.

I wish I had done this earlier, but its better to start late than never start at all, Right?
