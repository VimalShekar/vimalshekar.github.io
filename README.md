## Welcome to Vimal's Lab!

Hi There!

This is Vimal, Welcome to my page... 

This is where I post some of my blogs, sample code, and libraries as I learn and explore technologies, and its made available with an intent that it should be searchable by my future self and of course by anyone else. I don't intend to make any profit, harm or hurt anyone in any way - with the content here. I would appreciate it if you let me know if you find something derogatory, or if you find something useful. Since comments are not up yet - be sure to drop me an email. It's a feel good factor for me.... :)


## A little about myself!
I am a software developer with about 8 years of IT experience. I started my career with Microsoft as a support engineer - troubleshooting/supporting Windows for Microsoft's Enterprise customers. Soon I got promoted to the Beta engineer role - where I was involved in testing pre-release versions of Windows 8 & 8.1. In these roles, I gained good architecture and component knowledge about Windows, and started to build my areas of focus. 

I always wanted a role where I could contribute code, debug and learn new things. With that intent - I started reading Windows internals, brushed up the C/C++ and assembly language I learnt in college, and applied for the role of an Escalation Engineer with the Windows Debugging team. After a six month internship - I was offered the role. Here I dealt with debugging user and kernel mode crashes, hangs, performance, security and behavioral problems with Windows. It involved reverse engineering, walking through assembly, writing and reviewing Windows and third party source code (C, C++, C# and PowerShell). 

After about 6 years at Microsoft, I decided to take on a more challenging development profile at a Network Security Start-up called Attivo Networks. Attivo is a pioneer in ‚ÄúDeception Technology‚Äù. The company focuses on using deception to detect intrusions and to collect post exploit forensics. At Attivo, I spearheaded their Active Directory Deception integration feature and worked on VM customization and endpoint deception and engagement tactics and on a feature that attempts to use Machine Learning to plot possible lateral movement paths.

## My Personal goals:
I have a passion for technology, and am thrilled whenever I get my hands dirty on new technologies and challenging problems. This blog here aims at tracking my learnings and also aims at providing a some help to anyone else who has similar interests.


## Why Github and Why now?:
In the initial years, I always shied away from sharing anything online and I wasn't a fan of Github either. In fact, until I took up my second job - I wasn't a big fan of Open Source. At Attivo, I started learning Linux and was re-introduced to open source with a different perspective. I was impressed with all the different projects running on Github and realised the potential benefits of sharing one's work, having other build upon it, and building upon other's work. This realisation is why I setting up a github page.

I wish I had dont this earlier, but its better to start late than never start at all, Right?
