## A little about myself!

Hi There!

This is Vimal, Welcome to my page. 
I am a software developer with about 8 years of IT experience. You can read about my roles on my LinkedIn Profile here:

In short:
I started my career with Microsoft as a support engineer - troubleshooting/supporting Windows for Microsoft's Enterprise customers. I was then promoted to a Beta engineer role - where I was involved in testing pre-release versions of Windows 8 & 8.1. I always wanted a role where I could contribute code and improve my Windows internals, C/C++ and assembly language. That is why I joined the Windows Serviceablity team as a Debug Escation Engineer. Here I dealt with debugging user and kernel mode crashes, hangs, performance, security and behavioral problems with Windows. It involved reverse engineering, walking through assembly, writing and reviewing Windows and third party source code (C, C++, C# and PowerShell). 

My development skills attracted a Network Security Start-up called Attivo Networks, they hired me as a Software Developer. Attivo is a pioneer in ‚ÄúDeception Technology‚Äù. The company focuses on using deception to detect intrusions and to collect post exploit forensics. At Attivo, I spearheaded their Active Directory Deception and automated VM customization and imports, and developed a shitload of endpoint deception features designed to trick attackers into our honey net. I also spent some time using Machine Learning algorithms, and also worked on a featuer that plot possible lateral movement paths of an attacker once he compromises a system.

Life is all about adventures, getting different experiences and learning and becoming a better person. To begin the next leg of my Adventure - I moved to Australia. Currently (as of March 2018) - I'm in Melbourne working at Tekspace Pty Ltd as their Sr Dev Ops, Automation and Cloud engineer. The role has a lot to do with automating a lot of Tekspace's Best Practice analysis, migrating customers to the cloud(AWS primarily) and creating budget forecasts and cost prediction using Machine Learning.


## My Blog goals:
I have a passion for technology, and am thrilled whenever I get my hands dirty on new technologies and challenging problems. This blog here aims at tracking my learnings as a reference for my future self. It also aims at providing help to anyone else who has similar interests.

In the initial years, I always shied away from sharing anything online. But soon I realised the power of open source, with the github projects. Its impressive how sharing one's work, having others build upon it, and building upon other's work makes life easy for everyone. This realisation is why I setting up this blog.

I wish I had done this earlier, but its better to start late than never start at all, Right?
