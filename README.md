## Welcome to Vimal's Lab!
==========================


Hi There!

This is Vimal, Welcome to my github page... 

This is just a place where I post as I learn and explore technologies. Here you will find my blog, sample code, and libraries that I thought I'd share with the world. Most of the entries here are posted with an intent that it should be searchable by my future self and of course by anyone else. 

I don't intend to make any profit, harm or hurt anyone in any way - with the content here. I would appreciate it if you let me know if you find something derogatory. On the other hand, if you find something useful - be sure to leave a comment for that as well, It's a feel good factor for me.... :)

## A little about myself!
I am a software developer with about 8 years of IT experience. I started my career with Microsoft as a support engineer - troubleshooting/supportinf Microsoft's Enterprise customers. Soon I was promoted to the Beta engineer role (I was the youngest Beta engineer at the time) - where I was involved in testing pre-release versions of Windows 8 & 8.1. In these roles, I gained good architecture knowledge about Windows, and started to build my areas of focus. 

I always wanted a role where I could code, debug and learn new things. With that intent - I picked up the Windows internals book, brushed up the C/C++ and assembly language I learnt in college, and applied for the role of an Escalation Engineer with the Windows Debugging team. After a six month internship - I was offered the role. Here I dealt with debugging user and kernel mode crashes, hangs, performance, security and behavioral problems with Windows. It involved reverse engineering, walking through assembly, writing and reviewing Windows and third party source code (C, C++, C# and PowerShell). 

After about 6 years at Microsoft, I decided to take on a more challenging development profile at a Network Security Start-up called Attivo Networks. Attivo is a pioneer in ‚ÄúDeception Technology‚Äù to detect intrusions and to collect post exploit forensics. At Attivo, I spearheaded their Active Directory Deception integration feature and worked on VM customization and endpoint deception and engagement tactics and on a feature that attempts to use Machine Learning to plot possible lateral movement paths.

## My Personal goals:
I have a passion for technology, and am thrilled whenever I get my hands dirty on new technologies and challenging problems. This blog here aims at tracking my learnings and also aims at providing a path to anyone else who has similar interests.


## Why Github and Why now?:
In the initial years, I always shied away from sharing anything online and I wasn't a fan of Github either. But Life is full of changes... and I'm setting on a journey of change myself... 

Now I've realised the potential benefits of sharing one's work, having other build upon it, and building upon other's work. This realisation is why I started my blog a few years ago. The idea of setting up a github page seemed like a natural progression. So here I am...  

I'm hoping that this page will soon replace my original wordpress blog, as the one place to go for all my work. If you find any of the content useful ‚Äì do drop a comment üôÇ
