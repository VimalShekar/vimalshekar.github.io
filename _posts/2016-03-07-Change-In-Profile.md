title: Changing my profile - joining Attivo...

Today is a big day, I bid adeiu to Microsoft and just joined a Startup called Attivo networks. The decision to leave Microsoft was definitely one of the toughest I had to make in my life. The past 6 years have been one of the best phases of my life! I've met some great people, had great friendships, got an autograph from Mark Russinovich, visited Atlanta, Shanghai, Seattle and North Carolina, participated and delivered trainings, gained appreciaion and recognition for my efforts. I could say - Microsoft almost became a part of my character.

Changes are inevitable, and in my pursuit for learning - I've decided its best to pick a Developer role with this startup. This will give me a great oppurtunity to peer into the security world. Its something I've always wanted to do. The next few years will be an important phase in moulding myself - I can use the skills I've gfained and learn new ones and hopefully contribute to something the world has never seen before.

I'm going to use this blog to post my learnings. Its primarily intended to be a reference to my future self, so don't expect it to be a step by step class. But the content will be interesting to anyone hoping to build a career in development or security.

Wish me luck!
