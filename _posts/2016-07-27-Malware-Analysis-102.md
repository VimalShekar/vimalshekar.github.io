The Assembly basics posts are happening and parallely, I thought of having some Windows Internals, PowerShell and Code samples posted here. I'm learning PowerShell and Python by myself and the learning is not always sequential. I'm learning PowerShell and Python from a practical approach perspective. What is the target I am trying to achieve, and then based on that I learn how to achieve it. So it doesn't make sense for me to post any tutorial like series for those. I will definitely post some sample scripts as I write them.

While I was at Microsoft, I was fortunate to have attended and delivered Windows internals and debugging trainings internally and to Microsoft's customers. When it comes to having a series on Windows Internals or debugging, I am at a good enough postiion to authoritatively post a series on the topic. I'm hoping to share some of the things I learnt during my experience and put it here so it may be a reference to others and my future self.

I'll link back to this post once I have sufficient articles.
