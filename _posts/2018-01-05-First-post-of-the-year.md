title: Migrating from wordpress to Jekyll

Today was an eventful day. I bid adieu to my company - Attivo and will soon migrate to Melbourne, Australia. I've just begun my job hunt and suddenly have some extra hours to play around with jekyll.

I've not been a big fan of blogging, and I hadn't really posted any of my code online for others to use, until recently. My <b><a href="http://vimalshekar.ml">old blog</a></b> was pretty basic, and that's where I used to put my stuff. Jekyll and Github pages now make things a lot easier, so I decided to move over here. 

For now, most of the posts here are just a copy of what I had on my old blog. Once I have more time, and once I get the hang of things with Jekyll - I'll upgrade the layout and improve the content quality... 


As I turn a new page in life - I hope to keep adding new pages here with the hope that someday, it will help others and my future self...
