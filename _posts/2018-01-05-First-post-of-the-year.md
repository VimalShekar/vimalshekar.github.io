title: Migrating from wordpress to Jekyll

Today was an eventful day. I bid adieu to my company - Attivo and will soon migrate to Melbourne, Australia. I've just begun my job hunt and suddenly have some extra hours to play around with jekyll.

I've not been a big fan of blogging, and I hadn't really posted any of my code online for others to use. My <b><a href="http://vimalshekar.ml">old blog</a></b> was pretty basic,
it had some scripts I wrote in the past, and some debugging lessons. I didn't have enough time to maintain it, or rather didn't think it needed time. 
 
Then recently, I've received emails from several people appreciating the script and asking for help with modifying some of them. This sudden chain of appreciation and realisation that my blog has visitors really struck me. I thought to myself - "I had never intended the blog for visitors, I just put stuff up for my own references. And Now its helping others too ?, wow :) Afterall helping others adds to good karma :)"

That's when I changed my mind and decided its time to take this more seriously. And that's how I got here to creating my own Github Page. For now, most of the posts here are just a copy paste of what I had on my old blog. Once I have more time, and once I get the hang of things with Jekyll - I'll upgrade the layout and improve the content quality... 


As I turn a new page in life - I hope to keep adding new pages here with the hope that someday, it will help others and my future self...


Thanks for visiting...
