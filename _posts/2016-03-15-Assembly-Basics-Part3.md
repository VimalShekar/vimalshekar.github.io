Instructions are classified based on where the data for the source operand of the instruction originates, and where the destination is. The data for a source operand can be located in:
* The instruction itself (an immediate operand)
* A register
* A memory location
* An I/O port

When an instruction returns data to a destination operand, it can be returned to:
* A register
* A memory location
* An I/O port

Based on the source and destination, the following are some of the most common addressing modes available:

|Instruction | Example | Description |
|---------|--------|------|
|Implicit | CLO -- clear overflow flag | The operand is not specified, the instruction implicitely knows where the operands are. |
| Register | CALL EDI  | The operands are registers specified in the instruction. |
| Immediate | MOV EBX, 0x123  | One of the operands is an immediate value specified in the instruction |
| Direct (Displacement-Only) | MOV EBX, [0x123]  | The operand is an address specified in the instruction. |
| Register Indirect | MOV EAX, [EBP] | One of the operands is a  memory location pointed to by a register |
| Based or Indirect | MOV EAX, [EBP + 8] | Address is obtained as a sum of a base register and an offset  |
| Indexed | EAX, 0x1234S[ESI] | Address is obtained as a sum of an index register and an offset |
| Based Plus Indexed | MOV EAX, [EBP][ESI] |  Address is obtained as a sum of an index register and an offset | 
| Based Plus Indexed Plus Displacement | | combination of all of the above |

Based on the type of operation, instructions can be classified into:

**Arithmetic and Logical Instructions:**
The binary arithmetic instructions perform basic binary integer computations on byte, word, and double word integers located in memory and/or the general purpose registers. The decimal arithmetic instructions perform decimal arithmetic on binary coded decimal (BCD) data. The logical instructions perform basic AND, OR, XOR, and NOT logical operations on byte, word, and double word values. The shift and rotate instructions shift and rotate the bits in word and double word operands.
