Now that we've looked at Windows XP's boot process, lets cruise through Windows Vista boot process. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. Power-On Self-Test (POST):
When the system is powered on, the BIOS performs the POST to check the hardware components and ensure they are functioning correctly.

2. Master Boot Record (MBR):
The BIOS/UEFI looks for the MBR on the first bootable device. The MBR contains the partition table and the boot code, which points to the active partition.

3. Boot Sector:
The boot sector of the active partition is loaded. This sector contains the code to locate and load the Boot Manager (BootMgr).

4. Boot Manager (BootMgr):
BootMgr is the first Operating system file to be loaded and this replaces the legacy ntldr. It reads the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store, which contains information about the installed operating systems and their boot parameters.

5. Windows Boot Loader:
The Windows Boot Loader (WinLoad.exe) is loaded. It initializes the hardware abstraction layer (HAL), loads the kernel (Ntoskrnl.exe), and loads essential drivers needed to start the operating system.

6. Kernel Initialization:
The kernel initializes the system, loads the registry, and starts the session manager (Smss.exe). The session manager sets up the environment for user sessions.

7. Session Initialization:
The session manager starts the Winlogon process, which handles user logins. It also starts the services and loads the user profile.

8. User Logon:
The Winlogon process displays the logon screen. After the user logs in, the system loads the user-specific settings and starts the Windows shell (usually Explorer.exe).

Let's look at some of the limitations of NTLDR in Windows XP and older OSes. NTLDR was simple, its main responsibilities included parsing the boot.ini (which was essentially a text file) and loading the kernel based on the ARC path. The reliance on text-based configuration made it less dynamic, adding, removing, or changing boot options required manual editing. This approach was acceptable at the time, but it had little room for error correction or robust configurations when multiple operating systems were involved. Windows XP’s boot process offered very limited recovery options and No Native Support for Modern Technologies such as full disk encryption and handling preboot environments like UEFI. 

Enter BOOTMGR (Windows Boot Manager)
BootMgr incorporated several new concepts and improvements. First - rather than using a simple text file like boot.ini, BOOTMGR relies on the Boot Configuration Data store (BCD). This is a structured, firmware‑independent database that offers granular control over boot parameters. The BCD allows dynamic reconfiguration of boot settings, multi-boot support, and is less error-prone than a manually edited text file. It enables a more robust environment for dual-boot or multi-OS configurations, something NTLDR struggled with.

BootMgr improved Security and Recovery Options bu allowing checking the integrity of boot-related files and offering a seamless transition into recovery environments. This is crucial for troubleshooting and system startup repair without needing external tools. 

BOOTMGR was designed to work with both traditional BIOS and newer UEFI firmware - which also meant that bootmgr was designed to work with GPT partitioned disks. From Windows 8 - support for BIOS was dropped in favor of UEFI which was more modern and allows for a more secure boot phase in conjunction with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware.

One of the key scenarios enabled by BOOTMGR is native support for BitLocker Drive Encryption. With BitLocker, the boot process is closely tied to preboot authentication and anti-tampering mechanisms (such as TPM, PINs, or startup keys). BOOTMGR detects whether a system partition is encrypted and can launch appropriate utilities (like winload.exe or winresume.exe) to ensure that the decryption occurs only after the integrity has been verified with the TPM.


Hopefully this gives you some clarity around how things evolved from XP to Vista. I'll talk about more boot changes such as Secure Boot, Measured boot and ELAM in Windows 8/8.1 in a future article.


Bye for now!
